# Gorilla REPL

Gorilla is a rich REPL for Clojure in the notebook style. If you're interested you should take a look at its
[website](http://gorilla-repl.org).

## This branch

[This branch](https://github.com/daslu/gorilla-repl/tree/languages)
is a proof of concept of accessing more programming languages from
gorilla repl.

## Details

R is accessed through [jvmr](http://dahl.byu.edu/software/jvmr/). Java is dynamically compiled using [janino](http://dahl.byu.edu/software/jvmr/).

## Usage

Todo: write the necessary details here (remember: JDK 8 is necessary
for the jvmr version in use here).

## Contributing

Contributions, in the form of comments, criticism, bug reports, or code are all very welcome :-) If you've got an idea
for a big change drop me an email so we can coordinate work.

## Licence

Gorilla is licensed to you under the MIT licence. See LICENCE.txt for details.
